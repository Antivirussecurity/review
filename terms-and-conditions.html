          <h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">Additional Terms Specific to AntivirusReview</h3>

          <p>
            In addition to the general Terms above, the following conditions apply specifically to your use of the 
            <strong>AntivirusReview</strong> comparison and review platform:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Editorial Independence:</strong> While we may receive affiliate commissions from some antivirus brands,
              our comparison tables, rankings and editorial content are prepared with the intention to be fair, informative
              and helpful for users. Compensation does not change our core review principles.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Information Accuracy:</strong> Features, prices, discounts and offers shown on AntivirusReview may change
              over time. You are responsible for checking the final details on the antivirus provider’s own website before
              purchasing any product or subscription.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Non-Endorsement:</strong> Appearance of any brand, logo, name or product on this Site does not mean we
              officially endorse or guarantee that product. Our platform is designed for comparison and information purposes.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Geographic Availability:</strong> Some antivirus plans, free trials, discounts or features mentioned on
              our Site may not be available in your country or region. You should verify availability directly with the vendor.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-0">
              <strong>Service Interruptions:</strong> Access to the Site may occasionally be interrupted for maintenance, 
              upgrades, security checks or technical issues. We are not liable for any impact caused by such temporary downtime.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Use of Reviews, Ratings &amp; Comparison Tables</h4>
          <p>
            AntivirusReview provides star ratings, pros and cons lists, expert verdicts and comparison summaries to help you
            quickly evaluate antivirus options. These are based on our internal testing criteria, aggregated user feedback and,
            where relevant, third-party lab reports.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="mb-2">
              Our reviews reflect opinions and analysis at the time of writing and may not represent real-time performance of
              a product due to updates, new versions or policy changes from the vendor.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              You should not rely exclusively on one score or ranking. We encourage you to read multiple sections such as 
              performance, features, pricing, pros/cons and user feedback before making a decision.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-0">
              Final responsibility for choosing, installing and using any antivirus software or digital security product rests 
              solely with you as the user.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Affiliate Disclosure</h4>
          <p>
            Some links on <strong>AntivirusReview</strong> may be affiliate links. This means that if you click a link to a 
            third-party site and purchase a product, we may receive a commission at no additional cost to you. This helps
            keep the Site running and allows us to invest in more in-depth testing and research.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="mb-2">
              Affiliate relationships do not change our obligation to present honest, useful and transparent comparison content.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-0">
              You are under no obligation to click any affiliate link or make any purchase through our Site.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">No Professional Advice</h4>
          <p>
            Content on <strong>AntivirusReview</strong> is informational only and does not constitute professional, legal,
            financial or cybersecurity consultancy advice. You should consult with a qualified professional if you require
            specific guidance related to compliance, corporate security policies, regulated industries or legal matters.
          </p>
